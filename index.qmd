# Preface {.unnumbered}

Solving optimization problems is my passion, but in my work, building mathematical models typically doesn't take much time. Instead, I spend most of my time implementing and fine-tuning various algorithms to solve real-world problems. I take great pleasure in transforming optimization models into software products, which requires proficient coding skills.

Java used to be my favorite programming language, but now Python is my second favorite, especially as I delve deeper into machine learning projects in recent years. 
I created this personal notebook to document my journey in improving my skills in data structures and algorithms, as well as to continue honing my Java and Python expertise.
