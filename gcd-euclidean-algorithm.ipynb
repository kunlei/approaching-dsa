        "# Eucliean Algorithm to Find Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\n",
        "\n",
        "The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both of the integers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it's the greatest number that is a common factor of both numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Leetcode Problems\n",
        "\n",
        "1. [1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-greatest-common-divisor-of-array/description/)\n",
        "2. [1201. Ugly Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-iii/description/)\n",

        "## Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take two integers, say 24 and 36:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n",
        "2. The factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\n",
        "3. The common factors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n",
        "\n",
        "Out of these, the greatest one is 12. So, the GCD of 24 and 36 is 12.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Euclidean Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "The Euclidean algorithm is a well-known method for finding the GCD of two numbers. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Given two numbers `a` and `b`, replace `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of the division of `a` by `b` (`a % b`).\n",
        "2. Repeat this process until `b` becomes 0.\n",
        "3. The GCD is the non-zero number remaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps in the Euclidean Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's find the GCD of 48 and 18 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initial values: a = 48, b = 18.\n",
        "2. Compute 48 % 18, which is 12. Update a to 18 and b to 12.\n",
        "3. Compute 18 % 12, which is 6. Update a to 12 and b to 6.\n",
        "4. Compute 12 % 6, which is 0. Update a to 6 and b to 0.\n",
        "5. Now, b is 0, so the GCD is the current value of a, which is 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder, and it can be efficiently computed using the Euclidean algorithm.\n",
